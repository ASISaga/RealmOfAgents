# RealmOfAgents

**Interactive Showcase Platform for Domain Specific FineTunedLLM(s) and Agents**

## Overview

RealmOfAgents is the dedicated repository within the ASI Saga ecosystem that serves as an interactive platform for showcasing and testing various Domain Specific FineTunedLLM(s) and Agents. This repository provides both the web platform and backend services needed to demonstrate AI agent capabilities in real-time.

## Purpose

RealmOfAgents serves as the demonstration hub for:

- **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuned Agents**: Interactive showcases of specialized AI models from the FineTunedLLM framework
  - Technical Domain Agents (software development, APIs, system architecture)
  - Medical Domain Agents (healthcare automation, clinical protocols)
  - Legal Domain Agents (contract analysis, compliance checking)
  - Financial Domain Agents (investment analysis, risk assessment)

- **Purpose-Driven Agent Demonstrations**: Live examples of autonomous agents with specific purposes
  - CoderAgent: Autonomous code development
  - LearningAgent: Continuous knowledge acquisition
  - KnowledgeAgent: Information synthesis and retrieval
  - IntelligenceAgent: Advanced reasoning and analysis

- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Real-time examples of agent collaboration using AgentOperatingSystem
  - Agent Teams: Collaborative problem-solving
  - Perpetual Agents: Long-running autonomous operations
  - Inter-Agent Communication: Live coordination workflows
